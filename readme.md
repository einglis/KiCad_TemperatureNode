# Temperature Hub

A little board with a few connections for one-wire DS temperature sensors.

Code is included for completeness only

After production, I discovered that A6 and A7 can't be used for digital IOs, so I bodge-wired them to D4 and D3, repectively.  This is reflected in the schematic, but not the PCB or gerbers.
